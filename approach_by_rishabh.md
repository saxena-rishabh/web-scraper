# Used Car Data Creation
### Approach: 
First of all, I Examined two car website (Droom and Cartrade), their HTML structure, CSS and various CSS classes and id used.
Then I searched a car name and analyzed the result page and HTML and CSS of the result page.
Then I begin to write web scraper using python. First I imported all the necessary packages required.
Then page URL is assigned to the "page_url" variable. Then the connection is opened and the HTML page is downloaded.
Then the HTML page is parsed into a soup data structure.
Finally, necessary logic is performed to scrap the data from the web page and write to the CSV file. The same process was repeated for the second car.
### Dependencies: 
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Urllib
